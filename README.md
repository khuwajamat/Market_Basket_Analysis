# Market_Basket_Analysis
## This is a Unsupervised Machine Learning Exercise, in which the ML model is used to generate associations of different products to one another.  
The project is using the apriori algorithm This is an excellent and efficient alforithm used in finding of several interesting association rules of products to one another. The Apriori algorithm is a popular algorithm used for association rule mining in data mining and machine learning. It is designed to discover frequent itemsets in a transactional database and generate association rules based on the discovered patterns.

Businesses (retailers) mostly use market basket analysis as a data mining tool to understand the preferences of their customers. Because of this, they are able to focus more on the needs of their customers, increasing profitability. This can show trends, such as the possibility that a customer who buys shoes in one store will also be interested in purchasing a jacket there.
